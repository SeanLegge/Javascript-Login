# Javascript-Login
By: Sean Legge
Date Added: May 28th 2017

This project was created in August 2015 as a school project. 

This basic project is a mock user login page. Testing basic javascript functionality. The user can mouse over buttons and the buttons act pressed when moused over. The user can click register and reveil a username, password and verify textbox. Once the user clicks save button a prompt appears with the username and password to prove that input was retrieved correctly. (I will be updating the visual design from the look that the project specified for during school.)
